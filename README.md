# Describing your data


This course is for students who have collected empirical data and will explore ways of describing data for scientific and translational purposes.
For example, students will explore different ways to explore and visualize their data, write about their data (e.g., a conference abstract vs. a blog post), present their data (e.g., a conference talk vs. a pop talk) and make their data more reproducible. Students will also read scholarly work (oversampling, though not limited to work on media effects and the science of science communication) and critique their work in relation to what is known about effective communication and reproducibility. Students should come prepared to engage with art, science and computer programming.

The course has two weekly components:

1. _Seminar session_: Students will discuss the readings and explore questions relating to open science and the relationship between academia and public forums. They will practice concisely framing and presenting their work in oral and written formats.

2. _Lab session_: Students will learn, practice and develop R programming skills for the organization, analysis, presentation and archiving of their data and research.
