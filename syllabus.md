### Course Description:

This course is for students who have collected empirical data and will explore ways of describing data for scientific and translational purposes.  For example, students will explore different ways to explore and visualize their data, write about their data (e.g., a conference abstract vs. a blog post), present their data (e.g., a conference talk vs. a pop talk) and make their data more reproducible. Students will also read scholarly work (oversampling, though not limited to work on media effects) and critique their work in relation to what is known about effective communication and reproducibility. Students should come prepared to engage with art, science and computer programming.


### Assignments and Evaluation

Class participation + weekly assignments (20%). Our ability to have a productive seminar hinges on your ability to engage.  Please come to class prepared for constructive discussion.  Do the reading in advance.

* _Critiquing your colleaguesâ€™ data assignments (20%)_. As a scholar, you will have many opportunities to review and critique and contribute to the work of others.  In this course, we will practice giving constructive, helpful feedback.  You must provide your constructive feedback to your peers by 5pm on the day before the workshop. 

* _Final research paper (30%)_.  Over the course of the semester, you will write portions of research proposals and scientific papers that make use of your own data.  You will workshop a draft of your paper in class. As a final product, you will write a new draft that is suitable for submission, along with a response to your peer reviews.  Your grade will be based on your response to the critiques you received during your workshop period, as well as the overall quality of the final piece.  You should circulate your draft by 5pm on the Wednesday before your workshop (give your colleagues a week to read).  Your revision will be due two Fridays after the week of your workshop (i.e., 16 days later).  You must also turn in a markdown file that can produce all results reported in your final paper by the end of the semester.

* _Talk (10%)_.  Over the course of the semester, you will visualize your data and practice describing your data for non-specialist audiences.  This assignment will allow you to flesh out and refine one conference talk for a general audience (15 minutes will be the default).  You will give the talk to a team of your peers during lab time, and then will present to the class as a whole during seminar time. 

* _Grant pilot data (10%)_: Statement of 200 words or less on a potential new research direction or aim + 500 words + 1 figure for a pilot data section in a grant.  We will workshop these depending on time.  Grading will be based on initial work turned in.

* _Pop writing (10%)_: 1000 word pop summary of your work. We will workshop these depending on time.  Grading will be based on initial work turned in.

 

### Notes

* __Religious Observances__. Please submit your request for religious accommodations to me by the beginning of class week 2 so that we can work out an appropriate arrangement.

* __Computers and electronics in class_. No screens in class during discussions.

* __Academic honesty__. Please make sure you follow the code. Please touch base with me if you have any questions or doubts. http://www.upenn.edu/academicintegrity/ai_codeofacademicintegrity.html

* __Deadlines__.  Things come up.  You may have up to 3 days of flex time that you can use across the three assignments you turn in (paper revision, pop article, grant pilot data).  You may use these three days as you see fit (turn in the revision 3 days late OR turn in each in each of the three one day late, etc.).  Beyond that, you will lose one letter grade for each day late, barring extraordinary and well documented circumstances.

 

### Course Overview and Goals

* Move a paper toward publication
* Write and deliver one excellent talk
* Become an excellent and helpful reviewer
* Become a more informed scientist
* Develop R programming, web-presentation and github skills for the preparation, analysis, archiving and publication of your data and supporting documents online
